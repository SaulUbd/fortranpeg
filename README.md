# FortranPEG

FortranPEG is an online parser generator that uses a PEG grammar and generates a Fortran module with a recursive descent parser.

## Usage guide


First, you have to write the parsing expression grammar, for example, a simple calculator:

```
s = e

e = t "+" e
    / t "-" e
    / t

t = f "*" t
    / f "/" t
    /f

f = "(" e ")"
    / _ [0..9]+ _

_ = [ \t\n\r]*
```

Next, semantic actions can be added to the end of each rule in Fortran code within brackets.

To access the values within the body of the rule, a label can be defined. For example, in the rule:

```
f = _ [0..9]+ _ 
```

It could be: 

```
f = _ num:[0..9]+ _
```

Where "num" will be automatically declared in the rule function.

>[!NOTE]
>By default, these labels are declared as strings. It is the user's responsibility to return a desired type.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>By convention, in each rule function, a value and return type can be defined with the name "res".

For example, to return an integer from the rule:

```
f = _ num:[0..9]+ _
```

It would be: 

```
f = _ num:[0-9]+ _ {
    integer :: res
    read(num, *) res
}
```

The complete grammar can be found at this link:

[grammar.peg](https://github.com/ECYS-FIUSAC/fortranpeg/blob/main/test/test1/grammar.peg)


Now that you have the grammar, use the online generator to download the parser. It will be downloaded as parser.f90.

To use the parser, you will need a Fortran program that makes calls to the parse(input) function with the string to be evaluated.

Here is an example program for testing:

[test.f90](https://github.com/ECYS-FIUSAC/fortranpeg/blob/main/test/test1/test.f90)

To start using the program, it must be compiled as follows:

```
gfortran -c parser.f90
gfortran -c test.f90
gfortran parser.o test.o -o test
./test
```

>[!TIP]
>Alternatively, you can use a bash with these lines: \# bash [exec](https://github.com/ECYS-FIUSAC/fortranpeg/blob/main/test/test1/exec)

Congratulations :clap:! You can now use the built program!
